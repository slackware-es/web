    a/sysvinit-scripts-2.1-noarch-18.txz:  Rebuilt.
      rc.cpufreq: for CPUs that use intel_pstate, default to the performance
      governor. The performance governor provides power savings while avoiding
      the ramp-up lag caused by using "ondemand", which defaults to "powersave"
      on these systems. Thanks to EdGr.
    d/bison-3.1-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
